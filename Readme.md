## Notes
I have used fos rest bundle even though i haven't used it before to see what it is like and to not use ApiPlatform, because ApiPlatform makes things easy. That being said, there are still some missing things like, OpenApi documentation ( i have Nelmio API doc , but there is no description for the API-s). Other bundles used: AliceBundle ( fixtures ), Lexik JWT, JMS serializer.
